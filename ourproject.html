AARDVARK is a robot will follow the user and monitor their balance using a camera. When it is determined that the user is going to fall, the robot approaches the user and raises an arm in order to catch and balance the user. The robot stays like this until the user is stable enough to not require assistance. Once the user returns to a balanced state, the robot lowers the arm and continues to follow the user. The robot offers verbal and visual communications through a touch screen display. This display can display lists, such as grocery lists, communicate to emergency services if needed, and offer a visual face to the robot. 
<br><br>
This project is intended to act as a replacement for walkers, canes, and other walking tools. With AARDVARK, the user will gain more autonomy in their life. The robot does not need to be dragged alongside the user, thus freeing the userâ€™s hands and mind from using this tool.
